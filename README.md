### Hi there, I'm Loes! 👋

I was an attorney-at-law/legal counsel specialized in privacy & IT for almost 10 years. Now I'm making the switch from lawyer to web developer 🚀✨ As Captain James T. Kirk famously said, "to boldly go... where no Loes van Puijenbroek has gone before!" 🌌 

- ✨ Love all things front-end
- 📚 Expert on GDPR/privacy, IT-law & cookie legislation
- 🏃‍♀️ If I'm not coding, I'm running marathons & ultramarathons

Let's get in touch!
